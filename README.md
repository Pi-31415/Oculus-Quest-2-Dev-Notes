# Oculus-Quest-2-Dev-Notes
Development Notes for Oculus Quest 2 for Haptics Research

- Oculus 

## Workflow

- There are 2 ways to run the application, either on Oculus device, or let the computer take the load.
- It is complicated to send serial signal out of Oculus Quest 2 to the haptics motor on the hand via wire, if the application is run on Oculus device. Therefore, we will run the app on computer and use Oculus as a display device only.
