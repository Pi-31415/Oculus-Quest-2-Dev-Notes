# Oculus-Quest-2-Dev-Notes
Development Notes for Oculus Quest 2 for Haptics Research

- Oculus 

## Workflow

- There are 2 ways to run the application, either on Oculus device, or let the computer take the load.
- It is complicated to send serial signal out of Oculus Quest 2 to the haptics motor on the hand via wire, if the application is run on Oculus device. Therefore, we will run the app on computer and use Oculus as a display device only.


## Troubleshooting

- Fails with Error "THE VULKAN GRAPHICS API DOES NOT SUPPORT XR IN YOUR CONFIGURATION" WHEN USING VULKAN GRAPHICS API ([Solution](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/build-fails-with-error-the-vulkan-graphics-api-does-not-support-xr-in-your-configuration-when-using-vulkan-graphics-api))
